### Management Comments:

* **May/2022 - October/2022 (Initial Phase - Adaptation Challenges):**
    * "Bruno demonstrated difficulties in the initial phase. His **delivery delay rate** was consistently above average, and there were some reports of inattention when checking packages. He required closer monitoring to understand routing procedures and app usage. Communication with the team and management also needs improvement."
* **November/2022 - April/2024 (Below Expectation Performance):**
    * "Despite constant training and feedback, Bruno's performance remains below expectations. **Delays persist**, and inefficient route usage impacts his productivity. There have been some minor incidents of damaged packages and occasional customer complaints about his demeanor. He shows little proactivity in seeking solutions for his challenges and tends not to communicate problems in a timely manner. Punctuality has been an intermittent issue."
* **May/2024 - Present (Urgent Need for Improvement):**
    * "Bruno's performance has been a **constant concern**. The problems with punctuality, communication, and, more recently, unjustified absenteeism, directly impact operations. We need to see significant and immediate improvement in his organization and commitment. We are in an intensive monitoring process to verify his ability to meet company expectations. If there is no change, we will need to re-evaluate his position."
