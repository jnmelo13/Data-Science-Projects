# Service: LLM Commute (Pre-Scheduled People Transportation)

## Overview
**LLM Commute** is LLM Deliveries' solution for **pre-scheduled people transportation from point A to point B**, offering convenience, safety, and punctuality. Unlike on-demand ride-hailing services, we focus on the organization and efficiency of planned journeys, optimized by the intelligence of our **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, to ensure a smooth and predictable experience.

## How It Works
1.  **Simplified Scheduling:** The user requests a ride in advance (hours or days), providing origin, destination, date, time, and number of passengers, via the app or web dashboard.
2.  **Route Selection and Optimization (with LLMs):** Our LLMs process the request, considering the scheduled time window, expected traffic conditions, and partner fleet availability to determine the most efficient route and predict the exact arrival time.
3.  **Smart Driver/Vehicle Assignment:** The system assigns the most suitable driver and vehicle for the scheduled ride, taking into account the driver's prior location, their next appointment, and the required vehicle type.
4.  **Confirmation and Reminders:** The user receives booking confirmation and reminders closer to the travel time, including driver and vehicle details. Our LLMs can generate proactive notifications in case of traffic changes that might affect the schedule.
5.  **Journey and Monitoring:** At the scheduled time, the driver carries out the ride following the optimized route. The user, and if applicable, the company's mobility manager, can monitor the journey in real time.
6.  **Feedback and History:** Upon completion, the user can rate the ride and the driver. A detailed history of journeys is available in the app.
