* **August/2020 - June/2023 (Stability and Good Goal Achievement):**
    * "Eduardo has established himself as a reliable delivery driver. He is fast with deliveries and generally meets deadlines. There was significant improvement in attention to detail after initial feedback. He is a **task-focused professional** who doesn't cause major problems. He maintains a good work pace."

We are working with him to improve this aspect and encouraging him to integrate more into daily team discussions."
